# HOW TO MOUNT A VOLUME IN LINUX?
# --------------------------------

# List block volumes
sudo lsblk -e7

# Let's assume our block name is "/dev/xvdf" from the list
df -ah

# CREATE A FILESYSTEM
# Note: 
# File structure is useful to the OS to structure the files & directories
# Without file structure, the OS will consider the disk as raw with just a stream of bytes without any proper structure

sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf

# CREATE MOUNT POINT & MOUNT VOLUME TO MOUNT POINT
# Note: 
# You can create mount points wherever you want; but using '/mnt' is standard practice

sudo mkdir /mnt/data
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/data

# MAKE THE VOLUME PERSISTENT
# Note: Persistent volume will make the volume available even after server restart

sudo vi /etc/fstab

# Add below
/dev/xvdf /mnt/data ext4 defaults,nofail 0 2

# Note:
/dev/xvdf      /mnt/data      ext4                    defaults,nofail                                              0                         2
device name    mount point    file system type        defaults = standard mount options (read/write, etc.)         back up file system       file system check order
                              (common for linux)      nofail = system won't fail to boot if this mount fails       (0: No)                   1 = root filesystem
                                                                                                                                             2 = others
                                                                                                                                             0 = don't check
