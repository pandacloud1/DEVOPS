# Create a user playbook

## Create a user with name 'alexa'
```sh
vi user.yaml
```
```yaml
---
- name: create a user
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
   - name: create user
     user:
        name: alexa
...
```
```sh
ansible-playbook user.yaml
```
Verify if users are created in the Nodes 
```sh
cat /etc/passwd
```
OR run in Master
```sh
ansible all -a "cat /etc/passwd"
```

## Create a user with shell & home directory
```sh
vi user.yaml
```
```yaml
---
- name: user module
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
  - name: create user
    ansible.builtin.user: 
      name: alexa
      state: present
      home: /home/alexa
      create_home: yes
      shell: /bin/bash
...
```
```sh
ansible-playbook user.yaml
```
Note:
* You can use `user` instead of `ansible.builtin.user`, as it is the default collection
* But `user` can be a part of different collections
* Hence, it is suggested to use `ansible.builtin.user` as a standard practice.
* Here, `ansible.builtin.user` is a FQCN (Fully Qualified Collection Name)
