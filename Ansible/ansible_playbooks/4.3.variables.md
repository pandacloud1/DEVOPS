# Using variables in Ansible playbook
Note:
* Variables are repetitive values used in Ansible playbooks
* They only contain letter, numbers & underscore (we cannot use dash `-`) & should always start with a letter
* They are written under `vars` block and called using `"{{ <var> }}"`

```sh
vi apache.yaml
```
```yaml
---
- name: apache
  hosts: all
  become: true

  vars:
    a: httpd

  tasks:
  - name: install httpd
    yum: 
      name: "{{ a }}"
      state: present

  - name: start httpd
    service: 
      name: "{{ a }}"
      state: installed
...
```
```sh
ansible-playbook apache.yaml
```
