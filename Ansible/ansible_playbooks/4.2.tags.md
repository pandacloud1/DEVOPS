# Run specific task using `tags`
Note:
* Tags are used to run specific task from a long playbook
* They are written under `tags` & are called using flag `-t <task-name>`

```sh
vi apache.yaml
```
```yaml
---
- name: apache
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
  - name: install httpd
    tags: i-httpd
    yum: 
      name: httpd
      state: present

  - name: start httpd
    tags: s-httpd
    service: 
      name: httpd
      state: installed
...
```
Let's say I want to install httpd only
```sh
ansible-playbook apache.yaml -t i-httpd
```
