kubectl delete pod my-pod1                                        #(to delete the pod)
kubectl delete -f pod.yaml                                        #(to delete the manifest)

# -------
# NOTE:
# -------
1. Pod can be easily deleted by running below
   kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
2. To avoid losing pod, use 'ReplicationController' or 'ReplicaSet' or 'Deployment')
3. 'ReplicationController' is old form of K8s & not used anymore
