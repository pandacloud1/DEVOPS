# üîÅ REPLICATION CONTROLLER
## üìå Tips for Using ReplicationController

1. To use a **ReplicationController** instead of a Pod, you must define:
   - `replicas`
   - `selector`
   - `template`  
   _(Think of it as the **RST** under `spec`)_
2. The entire **Pod metadata** goes under the `template` section, including labels.
3. The correct `apiVersion` for ReplicaSet is 'v1'

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## üì¶ Commands

```sh
kubectl apply -f rc.yaml                      # Create the ReplicationController
kubectl get rc                                # List all ReplicationControllers
kubectl describe rc nginx                     # Get detailed info about the RC

pods=$(kubectl get pods -l app=nginx -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
echo $pods                                    # Print the names of the pods

kubectl get pods                              # List all pods (e.g., nginx-1, nginx-2, nginx-3)
kubectl delete pod nginx-1                    # Delete a pod and observe auto-replacement
```

## üìù Notes

1. **ReplicationController** is the older form of replication in Kubernetes.
   - It supports only **equality-based selectors**.
2. It has been **replaced by `ReplicaSet`**, which:
   - Supports both **equality** and **set-based selectors**
   - Is used internally by **Deployments**
