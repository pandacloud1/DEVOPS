kubectl describe rc nginx                     # Get detailed info about the RC

pods=$(kubectl get pods -l app=nginx -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
echo $pods                                    # Print the names of the pods

kubectl get pods                              # List all pods (e.g., nginx-1, nginx-2, nginx-3)
kubectl delete pod nginx-1                    # Delete a pod and observe auto-replacement
```

## üìù Notes

1. **ReplicationController** is the older form of replication in Kubernetes.
   - It supports only **equality-based selectors**.
2. It has been **replaced by `ReplicaSet`**, which:
   - Supports both **equality** and **set-based selectors**
   - Is used internally by **Deployments**
