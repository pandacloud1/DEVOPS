# 1. Replace 'kind: ReplicaSet' --> 'kind: Deployment'
# 2. Change the name under 'metadata' & create replicas as required

# COMMANDS
# ------------
kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml                                      #(to create deployment from the above manifest)
kubectl get deploy                                                #(to see list of pods, we can run 'deploy', 'deployment', 'deployments')

# Try changing the image to 1.20.0 & run below:
kubectl rollout restart deploy my-deployment                      #(to restart the pods in the deployment)
kubectl rollout status deploy my-deployment                       #(to check the new rollout status)
kubectl rollout history deployment/my-deployment                  #(shows the history of version numbers)
kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-deployment                     #(to rollback to previous version)
kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-deployment --to-revision=2     #(to rollback to specific version from history)


# NOTE:
1. There is no need to maintain separate yaml files for rollout/rollback, deployment maintains a history of deployments
2. Deployment itself cannot expose pods to outside world, we need to combine it with 'Service'
3. We need to combine it with 'PV/PVC' to integrate it with external storages.
4. Deployment is ideal for stateless applications like webservers.
   For stateful applications like Database servers, we use 'StatefulSet' object.
