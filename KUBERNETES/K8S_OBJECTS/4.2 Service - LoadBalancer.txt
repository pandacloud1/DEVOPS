# TIP:
# 1. To create 'Service' manifest, remember phrase 'The Service Provider'
# 2. Add 'type', 'selector' & 'ports' (The Service Provider)
# 3. Here 'port= service-port-no' & 'targetPort= pod-port-no' 
# 4. Don't forget to add the 'selector' to select the relevant labelled 'Deployment'

# NOTE:
# ClusterIP gets automatically created along with 'NodePort', which is default behaviour & meant is for cluster internal communication
# To allow networking, open SSH terminal in separate tab & run 'minikube tunnel'
# Then check curl <NodePort-IP> must work in SSH terminal
